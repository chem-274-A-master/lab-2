    "Previously, we simulated a Lennard Jones fluid using Monte Carlo methods. \n",
    "When performing the Monte Carlo simulation we generated potential configurations of our system using random movements of particles. The idea was to generate enough microstates at equilibrium to be able to analyze our molecular system for properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will use a different simulation method to do the same thing -namely generate potential system configurations. We will use a simulation method called **molecular dynamics** (MD). \n",
    "In molecular dynamics simulations, we simulate the movement of molecules by calculating the forces on atoms and updating their positions based on those forces.\n",
    "The output of a molecular dynamics simulation is a called a trajectory and simulates the movement of particles through time.\n",
    "When viewed, a trajectory is similar to a \"movie\" of particle movement.\n",

    "## Running a Molecular Dynamics Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will get hands on experience running and analyzing a molecular dynamics simulation.\n",
    "We will simulate the same system as before - a Lennard Jones fluid.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous lab, we wrote our own code for running and analyzing ouir simulation. \n",
    "This will usually not be the case!\n",
    "Usually, you would use code someone else has written for these tasks, input your specific system, then analyze for results.\n",
    "We will use the package [Atomic Simulation Environment](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) to perform our simulation. \n",
    "ASE provides a Python interface to molecular dynamics simulations.\n",
    "We will be using two other packages for analysis - [MDTraj]() and [MDAnalysis]().\n",

    "This lab will show many mathematical equations to explain the theory behind molecular dynamics simulations and the calculations we are performing. However, these equations aren't the *focus* of the lab. They're provided to give you context if you are interested. The goal of the exercise is to understand the basic difference between Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations and get some experience running and analyzing calculations.\n",

    "### Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "The next few cells walk you through running a simulation with the `ase` package. \n",
    "After you have been walked through the steps, there are exercises for you to complete at the end of the notebook where you will \n",
    "vary your simulation parameters and compare the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our simulations will follow a procedure similar to the one we followed for lab 1.\n",
    "We will still have an equilibration step, but our production simulation will be done with molecular dynamics instead of Monte Carlo\n",
    "\n",
    "Our procedure is outlined below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Set System Parameters\n",
    "For every simulation, system parameters such as the number of atoms, the temperature, and the box size must be defined. This defines the physical properties of the molecular system being simulated.\n",
    "This step will usually involve \"building\" your system, or setting coordinates of the atoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Equilibration Simulation\n",
    "An \"equilibration simulation\" is always performed to allow the system to stabilize before data collection. \n",
    "For our lab today, we will use our Monte Carlo code for an equilibration simulation. \n",
    "The equilibration will allow our system to reach the equilibrium energy value before we start the dynamics portion of our simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Set Molecular Dynamics Parameters\n",
    "For molecular dynamics, we'll switch to ASE. \n",
    "ASE does not use atomic units, so we will need to convert to real units.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional settings specific to the molecular dynamics simulation need to be defined. These include:\n",
    "  - **Number of Steps**: This specifies the total number of simulation steps for running the MD simulation.\n",
    "  - **Simulation Timestep**: This is the time interval for each MD step, defining how often atomic positions are updated.\n",
    "  - **Lennard-Jones Potential Parameters**: `epsilon` (depth of the potential well) and `sigma` (distance at which the potential is zero) in **real units**.\n",
    "  - **Velocities** - For molecular dynamics simulations, we will need to assign particle velocities. These will be based on our target temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Production Simulation\n",
    "Once the system is equilibrated, the production simulation is performed. \n",
    "This is the phase where data are collected, including atomic trajectories and energies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 7: Analyze the Simulation\n",
    "After running the simulation, you will analyze the generated data. This can involve calculating properties such as the radial distribution function (RDF).  \n",
    "Since molecular dynamics calculate time behavior of a sytem, we can also analyze time-dependent properties like diffusion coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Returning to Monte Carlo Simulation\n",
    "In the cell below, we set some simulation parameters in reduced units and perform an equilibration simulation using our Monte Carlo code.\n",
    "This cell almost exactly matches the first few cells of your first lab.\n",
    "The `run_simulation` function has been changed to also write XYZ files for visualization purposes."

For our Lennard Jones fluid, the pairwise sum of the Lennard Jones particles is our potential energy function, though the equation is more complicated for more complicated systems. When performing molecular dynamics simulation, we also rely on the fact that force is equal to the negative gradient of potential energy. \n",

    "1. View the [ASE repository](https://gitlab.com/ase/ase) on GitLab and take a look at the [repository analytics](https://gitlab.com/ase/ase/-/graphs/master/charts). What language is ASE written in?\n",
    "2. ASE uses many objects for calculations. Using the notebook cell with ASE imports, identify all of the classes we imported from ASE. \n",
    "3. In our calculation we used an [ASE calculator](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/calculators/calculators.html) for Lennard Jones. [View the source code for the calculator](https://gitlab.com/ase/ase/-/blob/master/ase/calculators/lj.py?ref_type=heads#L8). Looking at the class definition and constructor, identify concepts we've covered in our course such as methods, attributes, and inheritance. Take note of any syntax or content you don't yet understand in the class. As you look at the class, think about:\n",
    "    * How does the design of the Lennard-Jones calculator class demonstrate the principles of encapsulation or modularity?\n",
    "    * What are the advantages of using inheritance in the design of molecular simulation calculators?\n",
    "5. Pick one other class to examine and find it in the source code of the ASE repository (an IDE should be able to help you with this). Perform the same exercise as above.\n",

    "1. Decrease the reduced density of the system to `0.009`. Does this affect how long you need to run equilibration? (You should see energy level off in equilibration before moving on to MD). Doesstarting with a random initial configuration help with equilibration? Make a hypothesis about the observed differences.\n",
    "2. After equilibrating the system from (1), run MD. How does the different density affect your calculated properties like RDF or diffusion coefficient?\n",
    "3. Run a simulation at a higher or lower temperature and compare your results.\n",
    "4. Use [this talble of LJ parameters](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9783527676750.app5) to pick another substance to simulate. This will be easiest with atomic substances, as you will have to change sigma, epsilon, and the atom type passed to ASE (see the cell where we create the ASE Atoms object). If you are feeling **very** ambitious, you may try to simulate an LJ fluid for one of the molecules listed. You would still use the Lennard Jones calculator for this, but would likely need to figure out how to set the correct mass for the molecule."
